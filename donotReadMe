#start to import emc & core logic
att
#prepare for keystick session
i was building here,building there.
I must build something which is more closing the core.so I decided to choose keystick,commit an M tag.
#linuxcnc.in ready
I think,maybe,I will do some ui work.
#it's time to use makefile.inc
to many bin/script were faked,we need global path in makefile(submake like)
it's a great time to introduce makefile.inc
just for get global path
#turn to halcmd/loadusr/io
to many things to do before continue
#here is linuxcncsvr
as the title
#simplest make system
just make the gnumake system work.
#waiting for create linuxcncsvr
I was planning to copy whole linuxcnc.in,
now,I realized that linuxcncsvr must be created out first.
so,just hold the horse,let's build a linuxcncsvr first.
#now linuxcnc can use many foloder macros
not it looks like a linuxcnc script.
we are now focusing on linuxcnc.in,so all the changes are related to it.
#how linuxcnc was created
still talk about @xxx@
#configure something real.
${VAR1:-test} / ${VAL1-test} is same
-test is the default value if VAR1.
the @VAR2@ will be replaced,if you define the macro in configure.in

#the practice of autoconf
the start point is configure.in which was used by autoconf.

a version file is required at the parent folder.

	../VERSION

two makefile and one header file will be generate according the configuire.in,so two extra in file are required.

	Makefile.inc.in
	Makefile.modinc.in

autoconf wil geneate cache files.we provide a script for cleaning.

	autogen.sh
