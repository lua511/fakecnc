#simplest make system
just make the gnumake system work.
#waiting for create linuxcncsvr
I was planning to copy whole linuxcnc.in,
now,I realized that linuxcncsvr must be created out first.
so,just hold the horse,let's build a linuxcncsvr first.
#now linuxcnc can use many foloder macros
not it looks like a linuxcnc script.
we are now focusing on linuxcnc.in,so all the changes are related to it.
#how linuxcnc was created
still talk about @xxx@
#configure something real.
${VAR1:-test} / ${VAL1-test} is same
-test is the default value if VAR1.
the @VAR2@ will be replaced,if you define the macro in configure.in

#the practice of autoconf
the start point is configure.in which was used by autoconf.

a version file is required at the parent folder.

	../VERSION

two makefile and one header file will be generate according the configuire.in,so two extra in file are required.

	Makefile.inc.in
	Makefile.modinc.in

autoconf wil geneate cache files.we provide a script for cleaning.

	autogen.sh
